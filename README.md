## Overview

Track'a'Bug is a Project Management application that is intended for use as an internal tool within an organisation, to track software bugs throughout the entire process of development, testing and production.

I built this app with a React frontend and utilised Google Firebase to implement user functionality features, such as the ability for users to Sign Up, Log In, Log Out and Reset Passwords.

## Dashboard

After Signing Up / Logging In, you'll be directed to the Dashboard page which showcases the number of users using the software, total number of tickets, total number of projects, percentage of bugs that were urgent in the last 30 days, bugs resolved over the last 6 months and current bug tickets.

From the Dashboard, you can easily navigate to other pages within the application (Users, Tickets, Projects, Stats, Update Profile, Log Out) by using the Main Menu which is displayed on the left hand side of all pages within the app.

## Users

This page displays the Current Users using the application, and their user information such as User ID, Full Name, Email, Current Age, Username and Status in table format.

In addition to this, each User has their own Actions section within the table, where you can click the 'View' button and view all info that is specific to that User (such as their phone number, timezone and the bugs they have solved in the last 30 days) or click the 'Delete' button to remove the User from the Users table.

You can also filter Users by their User IDs, names, emails and usernames in Alphabetical order, their Age (Oldest - Youngest or Youngest - Oldest) and their Status (Active or Offline).

## Forgot Password

If an employee happens to forget their password they can easily navigate to the Forgot Password page from the app's landing page.

Once they are there, the employee can enter their account email and click the 'Reset Password' button.

If they entered their email correctly, a message will be displayed above the Email field informing the user to check their email for further instructions.

From there, they can click the link sent to their email address and reset their password. Simple!

## Projects

The Projects page allows the logged in user to view all the Projects that their organisation is currently working on.

Alongside this, the page provides a brief description of each Project, the Project Duration, Priority Level and the Assigned Team that are responsible for completing that project.

## Stats

The Stats page includes a bar chart displaying Developer Performance Ratings where Q1 & Q2 of this year is compared to Q1 & Q2 of the previous year.

There's also stats for Urgent / Non-Urgent Bugs in the Last 30 Days and for Bugs Resolved in the Last 6 months.

## Toggle Dark Mode

Within Bug Tracker, you can easily switch the app to the style that most suits you with the Light / Dark Mode feature.

It's super easy to switch between modes, just click the Light or Dark Mode colour swatch located at the bottom of the Sidebar Menu.

You can also click the half moon icon in the Navbar, when you click the icon the mode will automatically switch.
